# Capstone-3
This is my final capstone project for the 2023-24 RICE Fintech Bootcamp. This final project we were allowed to pick any subject that we have learned over the course of the bootcamp and should it be a good representation of what we learned throughout.

## Project Overview
This project was created to predict movie rating, and to determine whether the producer should make changes to their movie or pursue a different title.

We started off with a StandardScaler model but later focused on a Linear Regression Model since we were on a time crunch and decided to go with a more simplistic approach.

Somethings I would consider doing differently next time would be choosing different variable and maybe trying a more challenging Machine Learning Model.

Overall this was an amazing expiernce and I'm so glad I got to be apart of the last RICE FinTech Bootcamp course!
